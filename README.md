# Band_gap prediction using machine learning
+ project - Built a Machine learning model to predict the band gap of polymers(atoms).
- A prediction model using Ridge regression machine learning to predict the band gap of polymers.

-here we have done working:
1. data preprocessing.
2. feature selection.
3. feature scaling.
4. pandas
5. numpy
6. rdkit (use for chemical formulas to get array of equation of polymer)
7. ensemble technique (i have created my own ensemble model for regression purpose with hyperparameter tunned)
